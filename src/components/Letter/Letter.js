          <br/>
          I would like to apply for the job posted on your website as a web developer.
          As you'll see, I have hands-on experience efficiently coding websites using HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript.
          <br/>
          At the moment I'm running a small business with few employees, I built a system to keep track of
           stock and customer choices, and by now, it mostly runs by itself.
           <br/>
           Looking for something new to learn, I found Web Development, and it became my true passion.
           I did websites for NGOs, and friends, some I mention in my CV between my projects.
           I'm a fast learner, always eager to know more.
    <br/>
    I am confident I would be an
      excellent addition to {this.props.company} . In addition to my knowledge base,
       I actively seek out
       new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements.
           <br/>
